This repository displays some of my skills of automated testing. 

Q: How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A: Testing is an essential step in ensuring that your code, program, or software is functional and secure. You should implement testing throughout the development process, following secure coding practices such as input validation, error handling, and data encryption. Automated testing tools, like JUnit, can help identify vulnerabilities in your code and ensure that it meets functional requirements. Benefits of using automated testing include the ability to quickly identify issues and check the quality of each function, verifying that it behaves as expected.

Q: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

A: Understanding user needs is crucial for creating software that meets expectations. To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, you should gather requirements through user research methods such as interviews, surveys, and usability testing. Once you understand their needs, you can apply black box testing methods to ensure that the software requirements are being met. Continuously gathering feedback from users throughout the development process and making adjustments accordingly is important for ensuring that the final product meets their needs.

Q: How do I approach designing software?

A: Designing software requires a structured approach that begins with identifying the problem or need that the software will address. From there, you can define the functional and non-functional requirements of the software, such as performance, scalability, and security. Next, create a software architecture and design system components such as the user interface, database, and application logic. It is important to document the design decisions and ensure that the design is flexible and adaptable to future changes. Throughout each stage of the design process, testing should be implemented to prevent any potential issues from arising and ensure that the software meets its intended purpose. This limits technical debt and unforseen maintenance.
